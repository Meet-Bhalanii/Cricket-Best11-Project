# Cricket Team Selection Using Data Analytics

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on selecting the best playing XI (11 players) for a cricket team using a **data-driven** approach. By leveraging **Python, Web Scraping, Pandas, Power BI, and DAX**, we analyze player performance metrics to make informed decisions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Traditional player selection often relies on intuition and past experience. This project aims to introduce a **data-backed** selection strategy by analyzing performance metrics from the **ESPN Cricinfo** website.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Skills Used
- **Web Scraping** â€“ Python (BeautifulSoup) to collect data from ESPN Cricinfo
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** â€“ Pandas, Power Query
- **Data Modeling** â€“ DAX calculations in Power BI
- **Dashboard Creation** â€“ Power BI for interactive visualizations
- **Insights Generation** â€“ Data storytelling to finalize the best XI

## ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow
1. **Requirement Scoping** â€“ Identifying key metrics for player selection
2. **Data Collection** â€“ Scraping player stats from ESPN Cricinfo using Python
3. **Data Cleaning & Transformation** â€“ Processing and structuring data using Pandas and Power Query
4. **Data Modeling & DAX** â€“ Creating calculated measures and parameters in Power BI
5. **Dashboard Development** â€“ Visualizing insights using Power BI
6. **Final Selection** â€“ Using the dashboard insights to choose the best XI players

## ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides:
- Player statistics (batting, bowling, and all-round performance)
- Filters to adjust selection criteria dynamically
- Visualizations for better comparison and decision-making

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run This Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required Python libraries (`pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas`)
3. Run the web scraping script to collect data
4. Load the cleaned dataset into Power BI
5. Perform transformations in Power Query and create DAX measures
6. Build interactive visualizations to finalize the playing XI
